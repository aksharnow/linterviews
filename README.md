### Pre Interview Checklist

Please follow the instructions below very carefully and we will be calling you shortly for a mock interview.

1. Close all the apps except zoom and whatsApp on you mac(Please remove all the cluster from your machine during the interview).
2. Sit in the exact spot/place where you would sit to take the actual interview(Please don't say I will sit when in an actual interview.. we want to simulate the situation as close to as possible).
3. Have the charger connected to the laptop (Please don't say I have 100% battery, screen sharing/video/audio/coding quickly drains the battery)
4. Use the computer that you use daily, do not take interviews on your friends computer which you are using for very first time(3/10 interviews fail because of this reason as candidate gets nervous and do not know where to click and how to navigate and sometimes the interview meeting is auto joined on your friend’s name and makes the interviewer suspicious - RED FLAG).
5. Restart your machine(do this at-least 1 hour before the interview - 1/50 interviews fail because windows decides to update itself at the same time of the interview)
6. Have a headphones(in ear headphones with external microphone - NO BLUETooth headphones - sometimes the connections drop or battery dies)
7. Have a iPad and any other tablet connected to the internet(we need this at any cost as sometimes screen share make make your computer restart and we will use this as backup during the interview)
